# iOS UI Study

Personal study about iOS UI implementation programmatically without storyboard

## Goal

The goal is to create a collection of UI code that is useful, small, and simple.

Each app target will focus on a single problem and present a concise solution.

## Dependencies

I will use [SnapKit](https://github.com/SnapKit/SnapKit) for AutoLayout and use [RxSwift/RxCocoa](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift) to handle UI events.

## Installation

```
pod install
open Samples.xcworkspace
```
